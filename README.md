# Farmer's Market Need
## Project Goals
For this project, our team mapped the best places for Farmer's Markets in Denver. We defined best places for Farmer's Markets as places with the highest address density that are not currently zoned for Farmer's Markets.

## Why Farmer's Markets
Farmer's Markets encourage sustainable farming practices, provide an affordable way to access locally grown produce, support local economies, and combat food deserts.

## Data
We used two Denver Open Data data sources, [Zoning for Farmer's Markets](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-zoning-for-farmers-markets) and [Addresses](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-addresses).


## Steps
Aggregate address level data by latitude and longitude, as a proxy for population density. Sort the latitude and longitude by population density.

Use the zoning data to determine if the latitude and longitude is zoned for Farmer's Market use.

Make a heat map of the addresses that are and are not zoned for farmer's market use.
